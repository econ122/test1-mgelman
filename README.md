# test-assignment
The first day of class we will talk about creating version controlled projects in Rstudio. This first test assignment will not be graded, but it will give you a chance to practice the process of submitting  assignments to GitHub. 

Before day 2 of class (Thu 1/5), I will expect you to have reviewed: 

- [GitHub Classroom guide](https://github.com/jfiksel/github-classroom-for-students)

Then create a version controlled project for this test assignment using the repository that was automatically created after you accepted the GitHub Classroom assignment link. After creating this project, you will then have the file `test-activity.Rmd` in your `test-assignment` project folder. Edit this .Rmd to complete the activity, then commit and push your changes to your GitHub repository.
